## üìÉ Description

Engineering ToolBox is a comprehensive platform that combines powerful calculation tools with social features for the engineering community. The app allows users to perform both basic and advanced formula-based calculations, share engineering posts and solutions, engage in discussions through comments, and connect with fellow engineers through private messaging. Each user can maintain a profile, track their calculation history, and contribute to the community knowledge base.

## üîç Background Information

This project was created as part of our studies at General Assembly's software engineering bootcamp. We chose to develop an Engineering ToolBox because we recognized the need for a centralized platform where engineers can not only perform calculations but also share knowledge, collaborate on problems, and build a supportive community.

The combination of calculation tools and social features makes this app unique in bridging the gap between technical utility and professional networking in the engineering field.
